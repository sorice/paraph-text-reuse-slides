## Plagiarism Detection Roadmap

--

### Basic Problem of Plagiarism

> “The act of taking the writings of another person and passing them off as one’s own, generally in violation of copyright laws.”

- Source code plagiarism has been studied before the '80s.
##### (Parker1989) Internet upgraded that problem!
- Natural languague texts are the most plagiarised archieves.
##### (85% of Internet available texts).

--

### Basic Problem of Plagiarism

- A third of Turnitin.com papers have significant levels of plagiarism.
##### 40 million papers in accordance with Jon Barrie (founder of Turnitin) 2010 report.
- More copyright violations are among computer science students than in any other academic discipline.
#####(Barrie2010)

### Types of Plagiarism

### Paraphrase Plagiarism Recognition

#### [An open issue in computer science?]()

### Plagiarism has two parts

- Text Reuse Detection (click [→]())
- [Citation Analysis](#/3/1) (*click [↓]() for a summary*)
### 
#### This investigation is about [Text Reuse Detection →](#/4/1)

--

### Citation Analysis

>“The bibliometrics research area that deal with the study of citations: the relationship between a part/whole cited doc and a part/whole of the citing doc.”

##### Linda C. Smith (1981). *Citation Analysis*. Report at University of Illinois.
##### Morton V. Malin (1968). *The Science Citation Index: A New Concept in Indexing*. Library Trends 16 (Jan. 1968):376.

## Text Reuse Detection

>“the situation in which pre-existing written material is consciously used again during the creation of a new text or version”
####(Clough, 2010)

--

### Types of Text Reuse

```
python setup.py install
```

---

### Pretty Code

```python
for i in range(x):
    print (sqrt(i))
while (i > 0):
    if A == B:
        return True
```
